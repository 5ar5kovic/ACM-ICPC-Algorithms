<h1>Stooge Sort</h1>
<p>Stooge sort is a recursive sorting algorithm. It is notable for its exceptional bad time complexity. The running time of the algorithm is thus slower compared to reasonable sorting algorithms, and is slower than Bubble sort, a canonical example of a fairly inefficient sort. It is however more efficient than Slowsort. The name comes from The Three Stooges.</p>
